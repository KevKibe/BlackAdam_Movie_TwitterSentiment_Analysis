# BlackAdam_Movie_TwitterSentiment_Analysis
This is a project that i embarked on as a comic book fan to figure out how the public reacted to the new movie Black Adam on opening weekend. 
I decided to scrape data using python libraries such as tweety,to extract tweets and textblob to determine the context of the tweets.
